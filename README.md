# beanSEARCH

##### This app is a simple homage to the humble black bean. The design is mobil centric, because I think most people view recipe websites on their mobile devices.

This app incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pulls external data from the Edamam API, allowing the user to search for vegetarian recipes featuring black beans. The Edamam API allows a generous 5000 calls per month through the Developer option but limits API calls to 5 per minute, which is rather limiting for a recipe search website where the user might have to flip, tinder-style, through several recipies before something strikes them as yummy.  This problem would be eliminated if the developer had signed up for either the Startup or Enterprise packages, both of which allow more calls per minute to the API (15 and unlimited, respectively).  However, because the app was developed for learning purposes only she has decided to keep the app running with the free "Developer" package.

The opening page/screen has a cartoon black bean inspired by the cute, food-based artwork of Lisa Kirlew.  There is a short blurb on why black beans are so awesome, and the user will be prompted to click the bean to choose a random recipe including those fabulous black beans. Upon clicking the bean the next page loads with a recipe title a picture of the recipe and the option to click Beanie again to get a different recipe.  There is a note at the top of that page to click the title of the recipe to go to that recipes webpage.  To go back to the recipe search the user need only press the back in browser arrow. 

Bean appetite!
